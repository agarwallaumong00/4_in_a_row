# Problem statement
 - Programming Assignment Objective
    ● Please build “Connect Four” game using ReactJS, Html/Css as per design: https://xd.adobe.com/view/78f3c732-fbf8-4df5-9fcc-d1b7140f12ad-2da0/
    ● What is Four in Row Game? Try this Android App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quarzo.fourinarow
    ## Generic Guideline
        ● UI should look exactly the same. Though design does not have a responsive layout, please make it responsive with the best of your understanding. I.e. If a page has two main columns then break it one above the other.
        ● ReactJS, Html/Css should be used. If you are not hands on with ReactJs then you can use AngularJS or VueJS. But no Jquery.
        ● Feel free to use CSS code from design link shared. You can get CSS and Assets from this link itself. Try clicking various icons visible on the right side of the page to get Assets, Css etc. Feel free to use it.
        ● Once done, push code on github and share with the toothsitalent github handle. And/Or you can share code on jaimin@toothsi.in . Please also host online, (herokuapp.com , github.io etc ) and share links - Best to quickly check functionality before looking into code !!
        ● Expectations are that you build this same game but if you find it extremely difficult then make it as TicTacToe with the exact same UI. Only difference would be that the grid would be 3x3 and the winning logic would be different.
        ● The assignment may take 6 to 12 hours, you can submit it in a day or two or three depending on your existing commitments. Or try over the weekend if you can't find time at all during the week. Whatever be the case, since this assignment carries 80%+ weightage in decision making, take your time to deliver best.
