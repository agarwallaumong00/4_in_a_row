# Problem statement
 - There is a deck of 52 cards. You have to build a UI to draw 5 cards at random from this deck of cards. Once a card has been drawn, it’s removed from the deck and shouldn’t appear again. Build a UI in HTML/CSS/JS to draw cards on click of a button and show the drawn cards. A user should be able to repeatedly click the “Draw Cards” button to keep drawing cards until the deck is over. You also need to display all drawn cards till now in the UI.
